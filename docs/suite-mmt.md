# Suite

Use `type: suite` to define a suite MMT file. A suite allows you to run multiple tests together. Under the hood, Multimeter executes each test file specified in the suite.

Example:

```yaml
type: suite
title: Smoke Tests
tags:
  - smoke
tests:
  - test/login_and_get_user_info.mmt
  - test/create_session.mmt
  - test/get_user_info.mmt
```

## Elements

### title, description, tags
You can use these fields for documentation and to help with searching and filtering suites.

- `title`: The title of the suite.
- `description`: A short explanation of what the suite does.
- `tags`: An array of strings to categorize the suite.

### tests
The `tests` property is an array of strings, where each string is a path to a `.mmt`, `.http`, `.https`, or `.bru` file. A suite can run any combination of APIs, tests, HTTP files, Bruno files, or other suites.

Paths can be:
- **Relative** to the suite file's location (e.g., `../tests/login.mmt`)
- **Project root** paths using `+/` prefix (e.g., `+/tests/login.mmt`) — resolves relative to the directory containing `multimeter.mmt`

```yaml
tests:
  - ../apis/login.mmt
  - ../tests/login_and_get_user_info.mmt
  - ../requests/profile.http
  - +/tests/shared/setup.mmt           # project root import
  - ../suites/smoke_tests.mmt
```

See [Environment — Project Root Marker](./environment-mmt.md#project-root-marker) for details on setting up `multimeter.mmt`.

When converting larger Postman collections, Multimeter generates `multimeter.mmt` and uses `+/` paths in generated tests and suites so files can move within the generated project without breaking imports.

### Sequential and Parallel Execution
By default, all tests listed in the `tests` array will run in parallel. To control the flow and run tests in sequential stages, use `then` to separate the groups of tests. All tests between `then` separators form a group that runs in parallel. The groups themselves run sequentially, one after the other.

```yaml
type: suite
title: Sequential and Parallel Execution Example
tests:
  - test1.mmt
  - test2.mmt
  - then
  - test3.mmt
  - test4.mmt
  - then
  - test5.mmt
```

In the example above, the execution flow is as follows:
1. `test1.mmt` and `test2.mmt` start running in parallel.
2. The suite waits for both `test1.mmt` and `test2.mmt` to complete.
3. `test3.mmt` and `test4.mmt` start running in parallel.
4. The suite waits for both `test3.mmt` and `test4.mmt` to complete.
5. `test5.mmt` is run.

### Mock Servers in Suites

#### Suite-level servers (`servers:` field)

Use the top-level `servers:` field to list mock server files that should start **before** any tests and remain running for the **entire** suite duration. They are stopped automatically when the suite finishes.

> **Note:** `servers` is a **root-only** field — it only takes effect when the suite is run directly. If Suite A imports Suite B, Suite B's `servers` field is ignored. Servers should be declared in the root suite to avoid conflicts.

```yaml
type: suite
title: Integration Suite
servers:
  - mocks/user-service.mmt
  - mocks/auth-service.mmt
tests:
  - tests/login.mmt
  - tests/profile.mmt
```

This is the recommended way to manage mock servers in suites. It is safe even when the same test file appears multiple times, or when multiple tests use the same server — the server is started once and kept alive for all of them.

#### Inline servers in `tests:`

You can also include `type: server` files directly in the `tests` array. Servers start before tests in the same stage and stop automatically when the suite completes.

```yaml
type: suite
title: Integration Suite with Inline Mock Server
tests:
  - mocks/user-service.mmt    # type: server — starts first
  - mocks/auth-service.mmt    # runs in parallel with above
  - then
  - tests/login.mmt           # tests run after servers are ready
  - tests/profile.mmt
```

This lets you set up complex integration environments declaratively, without manual server management. The suite runner ensures servers are running before dependent tests execute.

## UI and Execution

When you open a suite file, the Multimeter panel displays the items in the suite, grouped by execution stage. Each item is shown with its name and an icon that indicates its type.

- **API**: Represented by an icon indicating the protocol (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket).
- **Test**: Represented by a test icon.
- **Suite**: Represented by a suite icon, indicating a nested suite.

This visual representation helps you understand the structure of your suite at a glance. You can run the entire suite from this panel.

### Node types
Each item in the suite tree is shown with an icon indicating its type:
- **API**: HTTP or WebSocket API file
- **Test**: Test file with steps/stages
- **Suite**: A nested suite (suites can include other suites recursively)
- **Server**: Mock server file (`type: server`) — started before tests in the same stage
- **Missing**: The referenced file could not be found at the specified path
- **Cycle**: A circular reference was detected (Suite A includes Suite B which includes Suite A)

The system automatically detects and prevents circular references. If a cycle is found, the offending entry is shown as a `cycle` node and is not executed.

### Partial runs (Run on an item)
The Suite panel also supports running a single item (or a subtree) from within the suite tree.

- Suite runs are executed via a **suite bundle**.
- Each runnable node in the bundle has an `id`.
- Clicking **Run** on a node sends that node `id` as `target` to the extension host.
- Core executes the subtree rooted at `target` and emits reports tagged with the same `id` so the UI routes output to the correct item.

If you see output appear under the wrong item, it usually means report events are being routed without using `id` (or a per-run `runId`).

Here is a sample of the UI for running a suite:

## Running suites from the CLI

Use `testlight` to run a suite from the command line or CI:

```sh
testlight run path/to/suite.mmt --env-file env.mmt --preset dev
```

The suite runner executes stages sequentially. Within each stage (items between `then` separators), tests run in parallel. Results are reported per item.

---

### Environment Configuration

Use the `environment` field to configure environment variables for suite runs. This is a **root-only** field — it only takes effect when the suite is run directly, not when imported by another suite.

```yaml
type: suite
title: Integration Tests
environment:
  preset: staging                       # preset from multimeter.mmt
  file: ./envs/custom.mmt               # optional: use another env file
  variables:                            # inline variables
    API_URL: http://localhost:8080
    TIMEOUT: 30000
tests:
  - tests/login.mmt
  - tests/profile.mmt
```

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `preset` | `string` | Preset name to select from `multimeter.mmt` (or from `file` if specified) |
| `file` | `string` | Path to an env file to load (relative to suite or `+/` for project root) |
| `variables` | `Record<string, any>` | Inline key-value environment variables |

#### Priority Order

Environment variables are resolved with different priority depending on the entry point:

**CLI (testlight):**
1. CLI `-e` flags (highest)
2. Suite `environment.variables`
3. Suite `environment.preset`
4. CLI `--env-file` + `--preset`
5. Project defaults (lowest)

**VS Code UI:**
1. Suite `environment.variables` (highest)
2. Suite `environment.preset`
3. VS Code local storage variables
4. Environment panel settings
5. Project defaults (lowest)

### Exports

Use the `export` field to automatically generate reports after suite completion. This is a **root-only** field — it only takes effect when the suite is run directly.

```yaml
type: suite
title: CI Suite
export:
  - ./reports/results.xml     # JUnit XML
  - ./reports/results.html    # HTML report
  - ./reports/results.md      # Markdown report
  - +/reports/results.mmt     # MMT format (project root)
tests:
  - tests/login.mmt
  - tests/profile.mmt
```

#### Supported Export Formats

| Extension | Format | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `.xml` | JUnit XML | Standard CI format (Jenkins, GitLab, etc.) |
| `.html` | HTML | Human-readable report with styling |
| `.md` | Markdown | Plain text report for docs/PRs |
| `.mmt` | MMT | Structured result data in YAML |

Exports are generated **after the entire suite finishes** (regardless of success or failure). Paths can be relative to the suite file or use `+/` for project root paths. Parent directories are created automatically if they don't exist.

---

### Root-Only Fields

The following fields only take effect when the suite is the **root entry point** (run directly). When Suite A imports Suite B, these fields in Suite B are ignored:

| Field | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `servers` | Starts mock servers before tests |
| `environment` | Configures environment variables |
| `export` | Generates reports after completion |

This design prevents conflicts when suites are composed hierarchically.
